Project Overview
Project: Weather Forecast App
Objective: Build an interactive web application that allows users to view current weather conditions and forecasts for different locations.
Features:
Location Search:

Allow users to input a city name or zip code to retrieve weather data.
Implement autocomplete functionality for city names using a weather API.
Current Weather Display:

Show the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy).
Display an appropriate weather icon or image based on conditions.
Weather Forecast:

Provide a 5-7 day weather forecast with daily highs and lows, weather conditions, and icons.
Optionally, include hourly forecasts for the current day.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the app is mobile-friendly and works well on different screen sizes.
Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout management.
Weather API Integration:

Use a public weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or MetaWeather) to fetch real-time weather data.
Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages.
User Interface Enhancements:

Implement a clean and modern UI with CSS animations and transitions for a better user experience.
Allow users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structure the web pages and forms.
CSS: Style the app, use Flexbox/Grid, animations, and responsive design techniques.
JavaScript: Fetch and display weather data, handle user interactions, and manage the app's logic.
